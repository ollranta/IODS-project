# About the project

# > # I'm very exited about this course because I like learning new thing about statistics and data analysis. I have already used some R in earlier courses but I can't say that my skills are on a professional level. 
> # I'm a bit disappointed that I did not find a way to download R-Studio to my own computer and I have to work at school for this course. Also I was not able to download Github or GIT for the schools computer because the administration forbids that. 
> Anyway I will just link my stuff to the online version since there was not another way to do that.
