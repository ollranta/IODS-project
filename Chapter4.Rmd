# Chapter 4, Clustering and classification, Olli Rantanen 17.02.2017

This time our exercise is about clustering and classification. Our data "Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston" has variables about crime, socioeconomical factors for example "lower status of the population" and many other kinds of information about the population on the area. The most important variable is crime (crim) which is described to represent the per capita crime rate by town. The data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns totally. 
Let's bring our data and have a look of its structure

```
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
str(Boston)
dim(Boston)

# 'data.frame':	506 obs. of  14 variables:
 $ crim   : num  0.00632 0.02731 0.02729 0.03237 0.06905 ...

 $ dis    : num  4.09 4.97 4.97 6.06 6.06 ...
 $ rad    : int  1 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 ...
 $ tax    : num  296 242 242 222 222 222 311 311 311 311 ...
 $ ptratio: num  15.3 17.8 17.8 18.7 18.7 18.7 15.2 15.2 15.2 15.2 ...
 $ black  : num  397 397 393 395 397 ...
 $ lstat  : num  4.98 9.14 4.03 2.94 5.33 ...
 $ medv   : num  24 21.6 34.7 33.4 36.2 28.7 22.9 27.1 16.5 18.9 ...
 
[1] 506  14
```
And let's have a closer look of the variables of the data frame

![](4_eka.jpg)


After that we can focus on making a graphical summary with correlation matrix

```
cor_matrix<-cor(Boston)

cor_matrix<-cor(Boston) %>% round(digits=2)

corrplot(cor_matrix, method="circle", type = "upper", cl.pos = "b", tl.pos = "d", tl.cex = 0.6)
```


![](corplott1.png)

From this matrix you can see, how the variables correlate negatively or positevely with each other. 
For example dis "weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres" correlates very negatively with age"proportin of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940", nox" nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)" and indus"proportion of non-retail business acres per town". So the bigger and redder the circle the more negative the correlation. 
Positively correlated are the circles which are big and most blue. For example rad "accessibility to radial highways"
and tax "full-value property-tax rate per\$10,000" correlate the most within our dataset. This chart makes it very easy to make observations of the correlation between the variables.


```

```

After that we can scale the variables to standardize the data set. If you compare this variable summary to the previous summary, you can see that the scales are very different on the first summary compared to the scaled one. For example on the first summary the minimum value of tax is "187" and maximum "711" compared to nox where minimum is "0.3850" and maximum is "0.8710".

```
boston_scaled <- scale(Boston)

``` 

The next part is to convert the dataset as dataframe and it is very simple with 
boston_scaled <- as.data.frame(boston_scaled) command. Then we move the crim variable as our
primary focus. This is done by making its values into categories.

```
Scaled crim

       V1           
 Min.   :-0.419367  
 1st Qu.:-0.410563  
 Median :-0.390280  
 Mean   : 0.000000  
 3rd Qu.: 0.007389  
 Max.   : 9.924110 
 
bins <- quantile(scaled_crim)
bins
           0%          25%          50%          75%         100% 
-0.419366929 -0.410563278 -0.390280295  0.007389247  9.924109610


Making it into the categories
scaled_crim <- scale(boston_scaled$crim)
summary(scaled_crim)

bins <- quantile(scaled_crim)
bins
table(crime)
crime <- cut(scaled_crim, breaks = bins, include.lowest = TRUE, label = c("low", "med_low", "med_high", "high"))

table(crime)
crime
     low  med_low med_high     high 
     127      126      126      127 
```
As you can see above the categories now have values ranging from low to high crime with each category having at least 126 values on their own. 

We can now delete the original "crim" from the dataset and add the new "crime" to it.
Then we can divide dataset to train and as test sets to make sure our model is working. It is always important to test how well the predictions fit to our model.
```
boston_scaled <- dplyr::select(boston_scaled, -crim)
boston_scaled <- data.frame(boston_scaled, crime)
n <- nrow(boston_scaled)

ind <- sample(n,  size = n * 0.8)
train <- boston_scaled[ind,]
test <- boston_scaled[-ind,]

correct_classes <- test$crime
test <- dplyr::select(test, -crime)
```

### Now we can fit the LDA on the train set.
Linear discriminant analysis finds the linear combination of the variables that separate the target variable classes. By this we can reduce dimensions of our data and cluster it.
We will use the newly made crime rate as our target variable. 
```
lda.fit <- lda(crime~. , data = train)
lda.fit
lda.arrows <- function(x, myscale = 1, arrow_heads = 0.1, color = "red", tex = 0.75, choices = c(1,2)){
  heads <- coef(x)
  arrows(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, 
         x1 = myscale * heads[,choices[1]], 
         y1 = myscale * heads[,choices[2]], col=color, length = arrow_heads)
  text(myscale * heads[,choices], labels = row.names(heads), 
       cex = tex, col=color, pos=3)
}

classes <- as.numeric(train$crime)
plot(classes, dimen = 2, col = classes,  pch = classes)
lda.arrows(lda.fit, myscale = 1)
```
And here is the result

![](lda_arrows.png)

The arrow that came through is rad, which means that accessibility to radial highways would explain the crime rates according to our model. We can test this with cross tabulating the data.

```
lda.pred <- predict(lda.fit, newdata = test)

table(correct = correct_classes, predicted = lda.pred$class)

 predicted
correct    low med_low med_high high
  low       13       9        1    0
  med_low    5      16        2    0
  med_high   0      10       17    2
  high       0       0        0   27
```
Looks like the most accurate prediction was with "high crime" and the lowest was with "low crime". This basically
means that its easier for the model to predict high crime rates and harder to predict low crime rates.

### Distance measures and clustering

We use manhattan and euclidean distance measures for finding the similarity or dissimilarity of objects. As we can see below these distances vary in many ways between all the core statistics.
```
data("Boston")
boston_scaled1 <- scale(Boston)
summary(boston_scaled1)

dist_eu <- dist(boston_scaled1)
summary(dist_eu)

dist_man <- dist(boston_scaled1, method =  "manhattan")
summary(dist_man)

dist_eu <- dist(boston_scaled1)


> summary(dist_eu) 
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.1343  3.4620  4.8240  4.9110  6.1860 14.4000 


> summary(dist_man)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.2662  8.4830 12.6100 13.5500 17.7600 48.8600 
> 
```
Now we can do the first clustering with calculated distances.
```
km <- kmeans(dist_eu, centers = 15)
km
# plot the Boston dataset with clusters
pairs(boston_scaled1, col = km$cluster)
```

![](eka_kmean.png)



We also do the k-means clustering which does unsupervised clustering based on the similarity of the objects. To do the K-mean function, it need an argument on how many clusters it uses. We will find the optimal amount by doing WCSS. WCSS uses total of within cluster sum of squares behaves when the number of cluster changes. This means when we plot the number of clusters and total WCSS, we will see a dramatic drop somewhere on the plot. When the dramatic occurs, this is the number of clusters we shoulds use. As you can see below this number is two.

```
set.seed(123)
k_max <- 10

twcss <- sapply(1:k_max, function(k){kmeans(dist_eu, k)$tot.withinss})
plot(1:k_max, twcss, type='b')
```

![](sum of squares.png)


```
# k-means clustering
km <-kmeans(dist_eu, centers = 2)

# plot the Boston dataset with clusters
pairs(boston_scaled1, col = km$cluster)
```

![](oikee_cluster.png)


It might be a bit hard to interpret any results on this because of the size of the picture. However we can see the red spot and black spot mixing and being separate also in some cases. Like rad and tax with crime variable. Medv (median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s) and age (proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940) seem to be mixing a lot.  

Let´s try the superbonus also cause why not
```
model_predictors <- dplyr::select(train, -crime)

dim(model_predictors)
dim(lda.fit$scaling)

matrix_product <- as.matrix(model_predictors) %*% lda.fit$scaling
matrix_product <- as.data.frame(matrix_product)

install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)

plot_ly(surfacecolor = train$crime, x = matrix_product$LD1, y = matrix_product$LD2, z = matrix_product$LD3, type= 'scatter3d', mode='markers')
```

Unfortunately the error message saying "Webgl is not supported by your browser" keeps
on coming and I was not able to download the wanted program for the school's computer.
I also tried changing the plot_ly funtion but nothing seemed to work.. 
Maybe 1 point for a good effort ;)



# Chapter 4 - data wrangling
This part is for the next week and it consists of data wrangling exercises which I will link to the Github also.

```
hd <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/human_development.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
gii <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/gender_inequality.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, na.strings = "..")
```
Let's explore the structure, dimensions and summaries of the data frames

```
dim(gii) 
195 rows and 10 columns

dim(hd)
195 rows and 8 columns

str(gii)

str(hd)

summary(hd)

summary(gii)
```
Then we change better names

```
colnames(gii)

 > colnames(gii)
 [1] "GII.Rank"                                     "Country"

  colnames(gii)[1] <- "rank"
  colnames(gii)[2] <- "country"
  colnames(gii)[3] <- "GII"
  colnames(gii)[4] <- "MMR"
  colnames(gii)[5] <- "ABR"
  colnames(gii)[6] <- "PRIP"
  colnames(gii)[7] <- "PWSEF"
  colnames(gii)[8] <- "PWSEM"
  colnames(gii)[9] <- "LFPRF"
  colnames(gii)[10] <- "LFPRM"
    
```
And do the same thing for HDI

```
  
  colnames(hd)  
  [1] "HDI.Rank"                               "Country"

  [5] "Expected.Years.of.Education"            "Mean.Years.of.Education"               
  [7] "Gross.National.Income..GNI..per.Capita" "GNI.per.Capita.Rank.Minus.HDI.Rank"  
  
    colnames(hd)[1] <- "hd_rank"
    colnames(hd)[2] <- "country"
    colnames(hd)[3] <- "HDI"
    colnames(hd)[4] <- "LEAB"
    colnames(hd)[5] <- "EYOE"
    colnames(hd)[6] <- "MYOE"
    colnames(hd)[7] <- "GNI"
    colnames(hd)[8] <- "GNIR_hdrank"
```
Then we combine the datafiles to have just one dataframe = human

```    
gii <- mutate(gii, edu2F_edu2M = (PWSEF/PWSEM)) 
colnames(gii)
summary(gii)

gii <- mutate(gii, labF_labM = (LFPRF/LFPRM))
human <- inner_join(gii, hd, by = "country", suffix = c("gii", "hd"))

```    
As you can see below, the "country" only exist once since the other one was deleted.

 ```  
 colnames(human)
 [1] "rank"        "country"     "GII"         "MMR"         "ABR"         "PRIP"        "PWSEF"       "PWSEM"      
 [9] "LFPRF"       "LFPRM"       "edu2F_edu2M" "labF_labM"   "hd_rank"     "HDI"         "LEAB"        "EYOE"       
[17] "MYOE"        "GNI"         "GNIR_hdrank"
```
